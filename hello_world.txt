i get why people say the whole "hello world" thing bc it's like "hey the first guy that made computers did it when he ran his first computer" 
or something like that, but the thing i don't get is why EVERYONE feels the need to tell each other do it.

this change is being made so i can test if this config thing removes the need for message flag... also to fix typos
